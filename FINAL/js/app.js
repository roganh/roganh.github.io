app.js
// two page site, main page and recipe page
// the recipe page will be like a database of recipes with links 
// the main page will be the "user page"
// this main page will have two input fields and a list of menu items pulled from the recipe page
// there will be two input fields (one for each person, displayed one at a time)

// user 1 will select on item from an abreviated list of menu items

// this input field will now disappear

// user 2 will then select an item

// there will be a function that will randomly select a winner unless the two choices are the same

// the winning selection will be displayed as all other items disappear from the recipe section.
